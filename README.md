  ## Description 
  Hey, welcome to the longest word, i have provided a fairly simple algorith you can use to input a sentence and out put the longest word in that sentence, punctuations ignored. The app takes your sentence and puts each word in an array and then loops through the array to get the length of each word excluding any punctuations, then returns the length to a new array. Then we us the Math.max() function on that new array to get the max number, if the array has more than one of the max number then the index of the first largest gets returned. When the index of the largest gets returned it is then used to return the largest word from the word array. There is also simple html integration, so you can input any sentence and get a better ui rather than using the console.
